# 3D Examples Gallery

Welcome to our collection of interactive 3D examples! Each example demonstrates different aspects of computer graphics and Web3D development, complete with live demos and detailed explanations.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the examples, make sure you understand the basic concepts:

- **Three.js Fundamentals**: Scene, camera, renderer, geometry, materials
- **WebGL Basics**: How 3D graphics are rendered in the browser
- **Vue 3 Integration**: How we combine Vue's reactivity with Three.js

## Example Categories

### 🎯 Beginner Examples
Perfect for those new to Three.js and 3D graphics:

- [Basic Cube](/examples/basic-cube) - Learn the fundamentals with a simple rotating cube
- [Lighting Demo](/examples/lighting) - Explore different lighting techniques
- [Geometry Showcase](/examples/geometry) - Discover various 3D shapes and primitives
- [Materials Demo](/examples/materials) - Learn about different material types

### 🔧 Intermediate Examples
For developers familiar with the basics:

- **Camera Controls** - Orbit controls and camera manipulation
- **Animation Systems** - Keyframe animations and transitions
- **Particle Systems** - Creating dynamic particle effects
- **Textures & Mapping** - Applying images and patterns to 3D objects

### 🚀 Advanced Examples
For experienced developers:

- **Custom Shaders** - Writing GLSL shaders for custom effects
- **Post-processing** - Adding filters and effects to the final render
- **Physics Integration** - Adding realistic physics to 3D scenes
- **WebXR Support** - Virtual and augmented reality experiences

## How to Use These Examples

1. **View the Demo**: Each example includes a live 3D scene you can interact with
2. **Read the Code**: Study the implementation details and comments
3. **Experiment**: Modify parameters and see real-time changes
4. **Learn the Concepts**: Understand the underlying graphics principles

## Technology Stack

All examples are built with:

- **Vue 3** - Reactive component framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **VitePress** - Documentation platform
